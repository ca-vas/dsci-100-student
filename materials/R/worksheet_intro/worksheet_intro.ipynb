    "Now that we have learned a little about Jupyter notebooks and R, let's load a real dataset into R and explore it. As we do this we will learn more about key data loading, wrangling and visualization functions in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Data about Runners!\n",
    "Researchers, Vickers and Vertosick performed [a study in 2016](https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-016-0052-y) that aimed to identify what factors had a relationship with race performance of recreational runners so that they could better predict future 5 km, 10 km and marathon race times for individual runners. Such predictions (and knowing what drives these predictions) can help runners by suggesting changes they could make to modifiable factors, such as training, to help them improve race time. Unmodifiable factors that contribute to the prediction, such as age or sex, allow for fair comparisons to be made between different runners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vickers and Vertosick reasoned that their study is important because all previous research done to predict races times has focused on data from elite athletes. This biased data set means that the predictions generated from them do not necessarily do a good job predicting race times for recreational runners (whose data was not in the dataset that was used to create the model that generates the predictions). Additionally, previous research focused on reporting/measuring factors that require special expertise or equipment that are not freely available to recreational runners. This means that recreational runners may not be able to put their characteristics/measurements for these factors in the race time prediction models and so they will not be able to obtain an accurate prediction, or a prediction at all (in the case of some models).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a better model, Vickers and Vertosick performed a large survey. They put their survey on the news website [Slate.com](https://slate.com/) attached to a news story about race time prediction. They were able to obtain 2,497 responses. The survey included questions that allowed them to collect a data set that included: \n",
    "- age,\n",
    "- sex,\n",
    "- body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m^2),\n",
    "- whether they are an edurance runner or speed demon,\n",
    "- what type of shoes they wear,\n",
    "- what type of training they do,\n",
    "- race time for 2-3 races they completed in the last 6 months,\n",
    "- self-rated fitness for each race,\n",
    "- and race difficulty for each race.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now use this data to explore a question we might be interested in - is there a relationship between 10 km race time and body mass index (BMI) for men runners in this data set. This is an exploratory data analysis question because we stated we looking for a relationship between measurements within the single data set we have and are not interested in yet interpreting beyond it. We can answer this question by visualizing the data as a scatter plot using R.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however we are not aiming to extend our findings to a broader population, make predictions, analyze cause or mechanics, we would need to state a different data analyis question and follow-up with different analytical methods to answer that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our exploratory question (is there a relationship between 10 km race time and body mass index (BMI) for men runners in this data set), we will need to do the following things in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. load the data set into R\n",
    "2. subset the data we are interested in visualizing from the loaded dataset\n",
    "3. create a new column to get the unit of time in minutes instead of seconds\n",
    "4. create a scatter plot using this modified data\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note 1 - subsetting the data and converting from seconds to minutes is not absolutely required to answer our question, but it will give us practice manipulating data in R, and make our data tables and figures more readable.*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Note 2 - many historical datasets treated sex as a variable where the possible values are only binary: male or female. This representation in this question reflects how the data were historically collected and is not meant to imply that we believe that sex is binary.*"
